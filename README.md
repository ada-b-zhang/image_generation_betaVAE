# Image Generation via Î²-VAE

In this project, I explore the **Beta-VAE model**, a variant of the standard **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**, using the [CelebA dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/therealcyberlord/50k-celeba-dataset-64x64). The goal is to train a Beta-VAE model and explore how different beta values affect model performance.
